7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

  - "Is there something wrong? Are you stuck on something?"
  - See if there is something going on that is preventing them from delivering what was promised, in which case we will revisit the assigned tasks or see if any leniency is allowed by the professor
  - If just stuck, help teammate out and let them know that they should always just reach out to us for help
  - If no excuse and teammate just not contributing, ask politely for a team member to put more work in. Remind them we have a client.
  - If still no changes are made then follow procedures outlined in project write-up of revisiting contract and involving professor/TA
  - Hold ourselves accountable through small self-made milestones.

8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

  Absolutely always be civil and ready to compromise. If a conflict occurs, discuss the matter and if don't come to a resolution then we take a group vote on the matter.

9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

  Meet as a group and discuss whatever issue we are having. Focus in on the specific part of the contract that discusses the issue and if we feel like it doesn't address it fully, we discuss as a group and take a vote to change it. Any group member could propose to revisit/change any part of the contract if they think it is unfair.

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

  After significant milestone, meet up with team and celebrate (a little).
